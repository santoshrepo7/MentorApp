/*
  # Add problem description to appointments table

  1. Changes
    - Add problem_description column to appointments table (nullable initially)
    - Add text search index for better search performance
    - Add constraint to ensure new appointments have a problem description

  2. Notes
    - Existing appointments will have NULL values
    - Future appointments will require this field through application logic
